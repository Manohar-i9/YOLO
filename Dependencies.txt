# Open your terminal and type the following commands one by one:

# To create an expo app:
npx create-expo-app your-app-name --template blank

# Then itll create a folder with "your-app-name", enter that folder in your terminal and type the rest:

npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-safe-area-view react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
npm install react-native-web @expo/metro-runtime react-native-webview react-native-video
npm install firebase
npm install @react-native-firebase/app

npm install @react-native-firebase/messaging



# For Alerts:
npm install dayjs
npx expo install expo-haptics

# FOR EAS:
npm install -g eas-cli
eas build:configure
eas build --platform android
npm install express
npm install firebase-admin




# Don't type this
npm install axios

# Then download & extract all the files from IDM-Files.zip into your app's project folder and then run your app

# To run your expo-app, type:
npx expo start

# To clear cache and run, type:
npx expo start --clear

# If you get axios error in App.js, just comment out that particular line and run again

# If you ever get ES Errors or nobridge errors resulting in a huge load of dependency errors
# Or if the system is throwing out a whole lot of dependency errors 
# Never try any of the chatgpt's recommendations of upgrading or downgrading npm modules
# Just follow all of these steps from the start again with a new name for your app
# This is the only fix for such errors
